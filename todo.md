## Implementations:

### Stateful Connection:

  1.  Stdout, Stdin using Printf and Scanf
  2.  Socket Programming using tcp 

### Stateless Connection through APIs(HTTP and HTTPS):

  1. mainLogic in the front-end (which is not good, as the expected answer will be in the front-end. So, it can be extracted)
  2. Storing the file in database. As the file contents won't be indexed.
